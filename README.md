# 📸 PhotoLingo

**PhotoLingo** is a lightweight, beginner-friendly application that helps users learn new languages by recognizing everyday objects and translating their names into different languages.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Choose a Language**  
   Select the language you'd like to learn.

2. **Upload an Image**  
   Upload a picture of a common object.  
   > ⚠️ *Note: Only very common objects are recognized for now, as the app uses a small AI model to save the user storage space.*

3. **Translate the Object**  
   The AI will recognize the object and provide **three possible labels** in your selected language.

## 🌍 What Happens Next?

Once you’ve uploaded an image and selected a language, PhotoLingo:
- Uses an AI model to guess the object in the photo.
- Translates the guesses using Lingva Translate.
- Displays the translated words so you can learn how the object is named in your chosen language.
- Translation history

## 🔮Coming Soon
- ~~Glass UI/UX~~ ✅
- ~~Translation history feature (already implemented, as seen in demos. Will be delivered in next release)~~ ✅

## 📢 Disclaimer

This is a passion project built using **only free resources**, so please bear with any limitations. Recognition accuracy will (maybe) improve in future updates if I get rich one day and can use a better model. Who knows, maybe some day I will train my own model and waste all of the storage on my hard drive.

Enjoy learning new languages with **PhotoLingo**! 🌐✨
